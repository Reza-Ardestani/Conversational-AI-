An immersive experience featuring local and national musicians, dancers and singers will set the stage for the three-day journey of connection, inspiration, and innovation that lies ahead.  Following the Opening Ceremony, we\u2019ll be inspired by an opening keynote from award-winning marketer and cultural translator Dr. Marcus Collins.   Dr. Collins has spent a career bridging the nexus of humanity and technology, with strategies and creative contributions that span music, sport, technology, advertising, and academia. Drawing from this experience and expertise, Marcus will share insights on how to create culturally contagious ideas that inspire people to take action.  Culture is a word we often use but seldom fully understand. So, why does that matter? Because there\u2019s no force more influential on human behavior than culture. What we wear, what we watch, who we marry, how we vote, what we support, and just about every aspect of daily living is informed by\u2014and in many ways governed by\u2014our cultural subscription.  At the end of the day, no matter what industry we\u2019re in, the primary goal is to get people to action\u2014to buy, to watch, to click, to vote, to subscribe. In this inspiring keynote talk, Dr. Collins will unpack how we can leverage culture to drive action where humanity meets technology.. \n The speakers of this session are: \n  - Name: Dr. Marcus Collins who has a position: Professor\n  - Name: Laura Kilcrease who has a position: Chief Executive Officer at Alberta Innovates\n  - Name: Chief Lee Crowchild who has a position: Former Xakiji (Chief) at Tsuut\u2019ina First Nation\n  - Name: Darrell Brertton who has a position: Saddle Lake Cree Nation\n\n",
