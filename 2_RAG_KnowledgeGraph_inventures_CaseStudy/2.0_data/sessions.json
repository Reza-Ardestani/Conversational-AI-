Following the Opening Ceremony, we\u2019ll be inspired by an opening keynote from award-winning marketer and cultural translator Dr. Marcus Collins.   Dr. Collins has spent a career bridging the nexus of humanity and technology, with strategies and creative contributions that span music, sport, technology, advertising, and academia. Drawing from this experience and expertise, Marcus will share insights on how to create culturally contagious ideas that inspire people to take action.  Culture is a word we often use but seldom fully understand. So, why does that matter? Because there\u2019s no force more influential on human behavior than culture. What we wear, what we watch, who we marry, how we vote, what we support, and just about every aspect of daily living is informed by\u2014and in many ways governed by\u2014our cultural subscription.
